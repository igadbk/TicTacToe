# TicTacToe

This project is a Python implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe for two players. The goal is to create a fully functional game that allows players to take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. Additionally, there is an option to implement an AI player that can play against a human player or another AI.

## Features

The TicTacToe game includes the following features:

- Two-player mode: Players can take turns entering their moves on the game board.
- AI player: The game supports the option to play against an AI player.
- AI difficulty levels: The AI player can be implemented with varying levels of difficulty, including an unbeatable AI.
- Interactive user interface: The game displays the current state of the board, prompts the players for input, and provides feedback on the game's outcome.
- Colorful console output: The game utilizes the `termcolor` library to display colorful and styled text in the console.

## Gameplay

The game follows the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

1. The game board is a 3x3 grid, where players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on empty spaces.
2. The first player to get three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
3. If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Usage

1. Run the game using the provided command: `python tictactoe.py`.
2. Choose the game mode:
   - Player vs. Player: Two human players take turns entering their moves.
   - Player vs. (Un)Intelligent Computer: A human player plays against a computer player with varying levels of intelligence.
   - Computer vs. Computer: Two computer players play against each other.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves and see the outcome of the game.
4. Press ENTER to continue after each game.
